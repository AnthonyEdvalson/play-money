# Play Money Web App

The **Play Money** web app is a lightweight Next.js application built with React and TailwindCSS.

## Features

- **Lightweight**: Encourages development to occur within feature packages rather than the main app.
- **Authentication**: Handled by NextAuth (soon to be renamed to Auth.js). Configuration is found in the `packages/auth` package.
